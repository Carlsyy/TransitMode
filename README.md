# TransitMode
TransitMode is a program that uses real-time transportation data and machine learning algorithms to suggest the most efficient and cost-effective modes of public transportation for your desired destination. With just a few clicks, you can enter your destination, remaining budget, and preferred mode of transportation, and TransitMode will provide you with the best available routes and transportation options. Whether you're traveling by bus, train, subway, or any other form of public transportation, TransitMode will take into account the time of day, traffic conditions(unsure), and fare prices to help you find the most convenient and affordable route. The program also offers a range of features, including route customization and a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to plan your commute. With TransitMode, you can save time and money while reducing your carbon footprint by choosing the most efficient and environmentally-friendly mode of transportation.

The main way this is achieved is similar to waze and grab, where the program has a database on certain transportation modes and the prices often given for each individual mode of transportation. Like grab having certain fares per km or jeepneys and buses with certain fares of km. The other modes of transportation like trains will not necessarily be time efficient as the lines for the trains can often affect the time spent for transportation.
